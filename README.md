struct AboutMe {
    std::string current = "Software Developer at Nokia";
    std::string education = "MEng in IT Automation Systems | BEng in Mechatronics";
    std::string location = "Wroc≈Çaw, Poland";
    std::vector<std::string> interests = {"AI/ML", "Reinforcement Learning", "Optimization Algorithms"};
};
```

Currently pursuing a Master's in IT Automation Systems while working as a Software Developer at Nokia in the telecommunications sector. With a background in Mechatronics Engineering, I combine hardware knowledge with strong modern C++ development skills and a growing interest in AI/ML technologies.
